## QUAPA benchmarks

## Description

Benchmarks found in this folder are derived from the collection of QASM files found in the QUAPA project.
Most benchmarks are provided with QASM source only in the QASM_src folder (legacy).
Various QASM files can be found in this folder which mainly scheduled for superconducting qubits.

- gst, qlib, scaffcc: Benchmarks derived from their corresponding libraries.
- sc7: Subroutines for a surface code 7 logical qubit.
- sc17: Subroutines for a surface code 17 logical qubit.
- logical: Various short routines to test a logical qubit.
- random: Random QASM files for 7 or 17 qubits with different compile settings.
- random_norm: Random QASM files for various number of qubits, both scheduled and unscheduled.
- rb: Randomized benchmarking QASM files generated by OpenQL.
- ./: Various hello-world like QASM files for testing.

## OpenQL random generator

The OpenQL random generator script can generate random circuits based on a distribution (CSV), qubit count, and gate count. Random generated circuits are directly forwarded to OpenQL and compiled. The QBT library is required to run this script.

## QASM to OpenQL

The QASM to OpenQL script reads QASM and inserts the operations into OpenQL. This allows QASM files to be compiled again using OpenQL. The QBT library is required to run this script.
