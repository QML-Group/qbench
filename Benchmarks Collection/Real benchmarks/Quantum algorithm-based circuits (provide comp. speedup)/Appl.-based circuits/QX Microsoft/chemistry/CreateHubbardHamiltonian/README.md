# Hubbard Simulation Sample #

This sample walks through constructing the Jordan–Wigner representation of the time-evolution operator for the 1D Hubbard simulation model, similarly to the [**HubardHamiltonian**](../../Samples/src/HubbardHamiltonian/) sample, but using the chemistry library to represent the Hubbard model.

## Manifest ##

- [Program.cs](./Program.cs): C# program that constructs a fermionic Hamilonian for the 1D Hubbard model.
- [CreateHubbardSimulationSample.csproj](./CreateHubbardSimulationSample.csproj): Main C# project for the sample.
