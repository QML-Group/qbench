Each edge has an id (its index, also used in the resource descriptions) in some contiguous range starting from 0, a source qubit and a destination qubit. Two grid forms are supported: the xy form and the irregular form. In grids of xy form qubits have in addition an x and a y coordinate: these coordinates in the X (Y) direction are in the range of 0 to x_size-1 (y_size-1).",
