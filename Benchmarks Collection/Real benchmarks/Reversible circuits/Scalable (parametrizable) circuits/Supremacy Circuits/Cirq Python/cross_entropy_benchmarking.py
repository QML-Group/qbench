    The depolarizing channel maps a density matrix ρ as

        ρ → p_eff ρ + (1 - p_eff) I / D

    where I / D is the maximally mixed state and p_eff is between 0 and 1.
    It is used to model the effect of noise in certain quantum processes.
    This class models the noise that results from the execution of multiple
    layers, or cycles, of a random quantum circuit. In this model, p_eff for
    the whole process is separated into a part that is independent of the number
    of cycles (representing depolarization from state preparation and
    measurement errors), and a part that exhibits exponential decay with the
    number of cycles (representing depolarization from circuit execution
    errors). So p_eff is modeled as

        p_eff = S * p**d

    where d is the number of cycles, or depth, S is the part that is independent
    of depth, and p describes the exponential decay with depth. This class
    stores S and p, as well as possibly the covariance in their estimation from
    experimental data.

    r"""Cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) of multiple qubits.

    A total of M random circuits are generated, each of which comprises N
    layers where N = max('cycles') or 'cycles' if a single value is specified
    for the 'cycles' parameter. Every layer contains randomly generated
    single-qubit gates applied to each qubit, followed by a set of
    user-defined benchmarking operations (e.g. a set of two-qubit gates).

    Each circuit (circuit_m) from the M random circuits is further used to
    generate a set of circuits {circuit_mn}, where circuit_mn is built from the
    first n cycles of circuit_m. n spans all the values in 'cycles'.

    For each fixed value n, the experiment performs the following:

    1) Experimentally collect a number of bit-strings for each circuit_mn via
    projective measurements in the z-basis.

    2) Theoretically compute the expected bit-string probabilities
    $P^{th, mn}_|...00>$,  $P^{th, mn}_|...01>$, $P^{th, mn}_|...10>$,
    $P^{th, mn}_|...11>$ ... at the end of circuit_mn for all m and for all
    possible bit-strings in the Hilbert space.

    3) Compute an experimental XEB function for each circuit_mn:

    $f_{mn}^{meas} = \langle D * P^{th, mn}_q - 1 \rangle$

    where D is the number of states in the Hilbert space, $P^{th, mn}_q$ is the
    theoretical probability of a bit-string q at the end of circuit_mn, and
    $\langle \rangle$ corresponds to the ensemble average over all measured
    bit-strings.

    Then, take the average of $f_{mn}^{meas}$ over all circuit_mn with fixed
    n to obtain:

    $f_{n} ^ {meas} = (\sum_m f_{mn}^{meas}) / M$

    4) Compute a theoretical XEB function for each circuit_mn:

    $f_{mn}^{th} = D \sum_q (P^{th, mn}_q) ** 2 - 1$

    where the summation goes over all possible bit-strings q in the Hilbert
    space.

    Similarly, we then average $f_m^{th}$ over all circuit_mn with fixed n to
    obtain:

    $f_{n} ^ {th} = (\sum_m f_{mn}^{th}) / M$

    5) Calculate the XEB fidelity $\alpha_n$ at fixed n:

    $\alpha_n = f_{n} ^ {meas} / f_{n} ^ {th}$

    Args:
        sampler: The quantum engine or simulator to run the circuits.
        qubits: The qubits included in the XEB experiment.
        benchmark_ops: A sequence of ops.Moment containing gate operations
            between specific qubits which are to be benchmarked for fidelity.
            If more than one ops.Moment is specified, the random circuits
            will rotate between the ops.Moment's. As an example,
            if benchmark_ops = [Moment([ops.CZ(q0, q1), ops.CZ(q2, q3)]),
            Moment([ops.CZ(q1, q2)]) where q0, q1, q2 and q3 are instances of
            Qid (such as GridQubits), each random circuit will apply CZ gate
            between q0 and q1 plus CZ between q2 and q3 for the first cycle,
            CZ gate between q1 and q2 for the second cycle, CZ between q0 and
            q1 and CZ between q2 and q3 for the third cycle and so on. If
            None, the circuits will consist only of single-qubit gates.
        num_circuits: The total number of random circuits to be used.
        repetitions: The number of measurements for each circuit to estimate
            the bit-string probabilities.
        cycles: The different numbers of circuit layers in the XEB study.
            Could be a single or a collection of values.
        scrambling_gates_per_cycle: If None (by default), the single-qubit
            gates are chosen from X/2 ($\pi/2$ rotation around the X axis),
            Y/2 ($\pi/2$ rotation around the Y axis) and (X + Y)/2 ($\pi/2$
            rotation around an axis $\pi/4$ away from the X on the equator of
            the Bloch sphere). Otherwise the single-qubit gates for each layer
            are chosen from a list of possible choices (each choice is a list
            of one or more single-qubit gates).
